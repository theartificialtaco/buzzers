INSTRUCTIONS (for organisers only):


the basic code for playing a sound with buzzers is
tone(buzzer, frequency, duration);

so for example:
tone(buzzer, 1000, 500);
in this case, buzzer is equal to whatever digital pin it is connected to


song 1 is shape of you
song 2 is never gonna give you up
song 3 is the smurf cat song


if you don't see any of the songs, it's because i'm still uploading them
